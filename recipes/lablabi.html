        <li>
            1 lemon

        </li>
        <li>
            4 cloves garlic , pressed

        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon salt

        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons olive oil

        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons white vinegar

        </li>
        <li>
            4 eggs (at room temperature)

        </li>
        <li>
            Salt
        </li>
        <li>
            8 oz. canned tuna (optional)

        </li>
        <li>
            Black and/or green olives (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Soak the chickpeas in a large amount of water with baking soda for 12 hours.

        </li>
        <li>
            After soaking, drain and rinse the chickpeas thoroughly.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the chickpeas and two pressed cloves of garlic in 4 cups (1 liter) of water, without salt, and over
            high heat for 15 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 1 hour.

        </li>
        <li>
            The chickpeas should be covered with about 2 inches (5cm) of water, so add water if necessary, during
            cooking,
            <br>

            so that the chickpeas are always immersed in water. When cooking chickpeas, skim the white foam
            that may form.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until the chickpeas are tender.

        </li>
        <li>
            Add salt to the chickpeas 5 minutes before the end of cooking.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
        Seasoning
    </h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
            In a bowl, add the lemon juice, olive oil, remaining garlic, harissa, caraway and half of the cumin.
            <br>
            Add salt and mix well with a whisk. Set aside.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
        Poached eggs
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a saucepan, bring 3 cups (750ml) of water with 3 tablespoons of vinegar to a boil.

        </li>
        <li>
            Break the eggs in small saucers, taking care not to break the yolk. Set aside.

        </li>
        <li>
            When the water comes to a boil, give it a whirl with a fork or a whisk, with a circular motion (like a
            whirlpool).

        </li>
        <li>
            Slide the eggs one at a time. The rotating movement allows the white to immediately wrap the yolk.

        </li>
        <li>
            Poach for 3 to 4 minutes while keeping the water simmering.

        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water for 3 seconds to stop the cooking.
            <br>
            Then, place on a cloth to drain.

        </li>
        <li>
            Season the poached eggs with salt about 2 minutes after cooking. Keep the eggs warm between two plates.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
        Assembly
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a deep dish or large bowl, place a few pieces of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Laden over chickpeas with a little of the broth.

        </li>
        <li>
            Place a poached egg on top, as well as tuna and olives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 2 tablespoons of seasoning.

        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle with remaining cumin. Enjoy very hot.
