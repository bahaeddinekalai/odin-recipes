    <h4>
        Dough
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the bowl of the stand-mixer, add the flour, sugar and yeast, and mix well.

        </li>
        <li>
            Dig a well in the center of this mixture and pour in the egg and oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start mixing at low speed and gradually stir in water until obtaining a homogeneous, light dough that
            detaches from the sides of the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add salt, increase the speed to medium, and knead for 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rise for 1h30 in a warm place, away from drafts.

        </li>
        <li>
            Once the dough has doubled in volume, place it on a lightly floured work surface and punch it down.

        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the dough into several pieces of about 1 ounce.

        </li>
        <li>
            Shape each piece of dough into a stick to obtain oval buns.

        </li>
        <li>
            Place them, with enough space between them, on a sheet lined with greased parchment paper.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cover them with a clean cloth and let them rise again for 20 minutes.

    <h4>
        Notes
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In order to obtain golden fried breads that are not too dark, place raw carrot sticks in the cooking oil.
            <br>
            Regularly change the carrot sticks while frying.
