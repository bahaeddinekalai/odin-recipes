        Steps
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Add Â½ cup (120ml) of oil into a large pan. Fry the onion over medium heat for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the garlic, tomato paste and harissa and continue frying for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the caraway, coriander, and chili powder. Mix and continue cooking for another 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the lamb meat and mix well so that the pieces are covered with the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes stirring
            regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with water. Add the turnips and carrots, and cook on low/medium heat for 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, prepare the couscous semolina as indicated on the package, with boiling water, salt, and oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 45 minutes, add the zucchini, potatoes and chickpeas.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cook for at least another 30 to 40 minutes over low to medium heat. Monitor the cooking of the vegetables.
            <br>
            If some vegetables are cooked before the meat, remove them from the pan and place them on a serving platter.
            <br>
            Proceed in the same way with all the vegetables to prevent them from cooking too much.
        </li>
        <li>
            10 minutes before the end of cooking, get a few ladles of broth (one at a time) and wet the couscous
            semolina.
            <br>
            Mix the semolina well after each ladle until it gets moistened enough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the semolina in a tajine pot. Decorate the dish with the vegetables and the meat all around.
            <br>
            Garnish with fried green hot peppers (optional).
